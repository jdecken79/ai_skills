Ensure Octagon MCP is configured in your AI agent (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.). See [references/mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md) for installation instructions.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Parameters

Determine your query parameters:

- **Start Date**: Beginning of date range
- **End Date**: End of date range

### 2. Execute Query via Octagon MCP

Use the `octagon-agent` tool with a natural language prompt:

```
Retrieve full historical end-of-day price data for the <INDEX> index from <START_DATE> to <END_DATE>.

**MCP Call Format:**

```json
{
