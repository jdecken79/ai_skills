# Industry Performance Snapshot

Retrieve daily industry performance data by exchange using the Octagon MCP server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Octagon MCP is configured in your AI agent (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.). See [references/mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md) for installation instructions.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Parameters

Determine your query parameters:
- **Date**: Specific trading date
- **Exchange**: NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.
- **Industry**: Biotechnology, Semiconductors, Software, etc.

### 2. Execute Query via Octagon MCP

Use the `octagon-agent` tool with a natural language prompt:

```
Retrieve a daily overview of industry performance for <DATE>, filtered by exchange <EXCHANGE> and industry <INDUSTRY>.
```

**MCP Call Format:**

```json
{
  "server": "octagon-mcp",
  "toolName": "octagon-agent",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Retrieve a daily overview of industry performance for 2025-01-09, filtered by exchange NASDAQ and industry Biotechnology."
  }
}
```

### 3. Expected Output

The agent returns daily industry performance metrics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Industry | Biotechnology |
| Exchange | NASDAQ |
| Date | 2025-01-09 |

| 2-5% | Strong move |
| 0.5-2% | Moderate move |
| -0.5% to +0.5% | Flat |
| -2 to -0.5% | Moderate decline |
| <-5% | Significant decline |

## Industry Categories

### Technology Industries

| Industry | Typical Volatility |
|----------|-------------------|
| Biotechnology | High (clinical trials, FDA) |
| Semiconductors | Moderate-High (cyclical) |
| Software | Moderate |
| IT Services | Low-Moderate |
| Hardware | Moderate |

### Healthcare Industries
