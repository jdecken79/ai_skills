# Historical Market Cap

Retrieve historical market capitalization data over a specified date range using the Octagon MCP server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Octagon MCP is configured in your AI agent (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.). See [references/mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md) for installation instructions.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Parameters

Determine your query parameters:
- **Ticker**: Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)
- **Start Date**: Beginning of date range
- **End Date**: End of date range
- **Limit** (optional): Maximum records to return

### 2. Execute Query via Octagon MCP

Use the `octagon-agent` tool with a natural language prompt:

```
Retrieve historical market capitalization data for <TICKER> from <START_DATE> to <END_DATE>, limited to <LIMIT> records.
```

**MCP Call Format:**

```json
{
  "server": "octagon-mcp",
  "toolName": "octagon-agent",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Retrieve historical market capitalization data for AAPL from 2025-01-01 to 2025-04-30, limited to 1000 records."
  }
}
```

### 3. Expected Output

The agent returns daily market cap values:

| Date | Market Cap (USD) |
|------|------------------|
| 2025-04-30 | $3.17 trillion |
| 2025-02-25 | $3.70 trillion (High) |
