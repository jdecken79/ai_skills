# Batch Market Cap

Retrieve market capitalization data for multiple companies in a single query using the Octagon MCP server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Octagon MCP is configured in your AI agent (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.). See [references/mcp-setup.md](references/mcp-setup.md) for installation instructions.

## Workflow

### 1. Prepare Company List

Compile the list of ticker symbols you want to analyze (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL).

### 2. Execute Query via Octagon MCP

Use the `octagon-agent` tool with a natural language prompt:

```
Retrieve market capitalization data for the following companies: <TICKER1>, <TICKER2>, <TICKER3>.
```

**MCP Call Format:**

```json
{
  "server": "octagon-mcp",
  "toolName": "octagon-agent",
  "arguments": {
    "prompt": "Retrieve market capitalization data for the following companies: AAPL, MSFT, GOOG."
  }
}
```

### 3. Expected Output

The agent returns a structured table with market cap data:

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap (USD) | Source |
|---------|--------|------------------|--------|
| Apple | AAPL | $2.99986 trillion | Octagon Companies Agent |
| Microsoft | MSFT | $3.143 trillion | Companies Market Cap |
